<p>My main goal during this project has been to lift the effect of the light beams being in the physical room. First implementation was by creating light sourcec along the light beams - this proved to be challanging
  since lightsources are rarely linear. <a href=https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/VolumetricLighting> Tube light</a>, volymetric light and emission workes best if baked (pre calculated light maps). Non-real time light was not an option.

As Robin persued post processing effects on the light - this would create local effect of light.
I chose to focus on the floor. What if I would create a shader that took the light beam location and
light up the detected plane mesh.
